# web

## Purpose

Vite SPA (React 19 + TanStack Router/Query + Tailwind CSS 4) for the analytics dashboard. Built and bundled into `packages/canonry/assets/` for distribution. This is the lowest-priority surface — never block a release on UI work.

## Key Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/api.ts` | `apiFetch<T>()` wrapper, `ApiError` class, all API call functions |
| `src/router/routes.tsx` | TanStack Router route tree |
| `src/pages/` | One file per page (ProjectPage is largest at 1,600 LOC) |
| `src/components/shared/ChartPrimitives.tsx` | Recharts wrapper — chart components and styling constants |
| `src/components/shared/ToneBadge.tsx` | Status indicator component with tone colors |
| `src/components/project/` | Project page section components (GscSection, TrafficSection, etc.) |
| `src/queries/` | TanStack Query hooks for data fetching |
| `src/view-models.ts` | Data transformation from API DTOs to display format |

## Patterns

### API calls (Critical)

**Every web call into the canonry API MUST flow through the generated
`@ainyc/canonry-api-client` SDK.** Raw `fetch()` and `XMLHttpRequest` are
banned in `apps/web/src/` (ESLint-enforced) — the only exceptions are
`src/api.ts` and `src/api-aero.ts`, which are the SDK wrappers /
EventSource consumers respectively.

Why: the generated SDK is regenerated from the OpenAPI spec on every
`pnpm gen`, so types stay in lockstep with the server. Raw `fetch()`
also bypasses the `heyClient` response interceptor that handles 401/403
auth expiry — a missed-fetch login bug is silent until the user
notices their session died.

Two ways to call the API; pick by what you're building:

**1. TanStack Query hooks (preferred for cached reads + mutations)** —
generated `<op>Options(...)` / `<op>QueryKey(...)` / `<op>Mutation(...)`
helpers from `@ainyc/canonry-api-client/react-query`, passing the
exported `heyClient` from `src/api.ts`:

```typescript
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { getApiV1ProjectsByNameOptions } from '@ainyc/canonry-api-client/react-query'
import { heyClient } from '../api.js'

function useProject(name: string) {
  return useQuery(getApiV1ProjectsByNameOptions({ client: heyClient, path: { name } }))
}
```

- Cache keys are derived from path + query params automatically.
- Auth-expiry (401/403) flows through the `heyClient` response interceptor.
- Generated types come from the spec; consumer types stay in sync.

**2. Typed wrappers in `src/api.ts` (for composites + imperative reads)** —
each wrapper is a thin shim over a generated SDK call that handles `ApiError`
mapping + 204 No Content + base-path resolution. Use them when you need
composite orchestration (parallel fan-out, multi-endpoint queryFn) that the
generated `<op>Options(...)` helpers can't express in a single call.

```typescript
const projects = await fetchProjects()  // returns ApiProject[]
```

If a wrapper you need doesn't exist, **add it to `src/api.ts` calling the
generated SDK function** — don't reach for `fetch()`. The pattern is:

```typescript
export function fetchMyNewThing(name: string): Promise<MyNewDto> {
  return invokeWeb<MyNewDto>(() =>
    getApiV1ProjectsByNameMyNewThing({ client: heyClient, path: { name } }),
  )
}
```

### Invalidation strategy

Pick by intent (documented at every call site in `mutations.ts` /
`run-invalidations.ts`):

- **Exact key** — `getApiV1<op>QueryKey({client: heyClient})`. Use for the
  literal top-level lists (`/projects`, `/runs`). Doesn't touch any
  per-project sub-endpoint.
- **Predicate by op-id prefix** — `query.queryKey[0]._id.startsWith('getApiV1ProjectsByNameBing')`.
  Use for whole-domain invalidations after integration mutations (Bing
  disconnect, GSC sync, GA sync, traffic source connect).

**Don't use `'getApiV1Projects'` as a prefix** — it greedily matches every
per-project sub-endpoint (Bing, GSC, GA, etc.) and churns unrelated caches.
For "the projects list" use the exact-key form.

### Spec gaps (loose-object endpoints)

A handful of endpoints (~41) still return `looseObjectSchema` in the spec —
the SDK types them as `Record<string, unknown>`. Two options when you hit
one:

1. **Add the schema (preferred):** define a Zod schema in
   `packages/contracts`, register it in `packages/api-routes/src/openapi-schemas.ts`,
   flip the route to `jsonResponse('...', 'YourDto')`, run `pnpm gen`. The
   `packages/api-routes/test/no-new-loose-routes.test.ts` count cap will go
   DOWN by one.
2. **Cast at the consumer (only if the schema work is genuinely deferred):**
   call the generated SDK helper and cast the response to the hand-typed
   `Api*` shape:
   ```typescript
   const data = (await queryClient.fetchQuery({
     ...getApiV1ProjectsByNameMyLooseEndpointOptions({ client: heyClient, path: { name } }),
   })) as unknown as ApiMyLooseShape
   ```
   Leave a TODO referencing the schema work.

**Do not add new `looseObjectSchema` routes.** The lock test
(`no-new-loose-routes.test.ts`) caps the current count; new endpoints must
ship with a registered Zod schema.

Base path comes from `window.__CANONRY_CONFIG__.basePath`. Never hardcode `/api/v1`.

### DTO types — generated vs hand-typed

`src/api.ts` re-exports the generated `RunDto`, `QueryDto`, `CompetitorDto`
as `ApiRun`, `ApiQuery`, `ApiCompetitor`. Use the `Api*` names — they're
the same shape but the alias makes it clear the source is the spec.

A few `Api*` interfaces remain hand-defined (`ApiProject`, `ApiSnapshot`,
`ApiRunDetail`, etc.) because the generated shape would cascade
`displayName: string | undefined` / `createdAt: string | undefined` drift
through every consumer that assumes those fields are always present.
Migrating each requires consumer-side review; track as separate follow-up
PRs rather than rolling into tooling work.

### Charting

**Recharts only, via ChartPrimitives.tsx.** Never import `recharts` directly. ESLint enforces this.

```typescript
import { CHART_TOOLTIP_STYLE, CHART_AXIS_TICK, CHART_SERIES_COLORS } from '../shared/ChartPrimitives'
```

### Component organization

- Don't create new component files unless the component is reused across 3+ pages.
- Section components live in `src/components/project/` for the project page.
- Shared components live in `src/components/shared/`.

### Data display

- Use **data tables** for lists of 3+ structured items (evidence, findings, competitors).
- Use **cards** only for insights/interpretations where narrative matters.
- Use **ToneBadge** for all status indicators. Map tones through helper functions.

## Common Mistakes

- **Importing `recharts` directly** — use `ChartPrimitives.tsx` exports.
- **Adding alternative charting libraries** (Chart.js, D3, Highcharts) — Recharts is the only allowed library.
- **Hardcoding `/api/v1`** — use the base path from `window.__CANONRY_CONFIG__`.
- **Using card grids for tabular data** — analysts prefer tables for scanability.
- **Adding decorative gradients or glow effects** — the design system is clean and flat.
